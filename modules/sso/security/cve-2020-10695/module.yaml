description: "Avoid CVE-2020-10695 by generating a new passwd file based on the
  chosen user ID and instructing the NSS wrapper to use this passwd file rather
  than to loosen the permissions of the system's /etc/passwd file from its
  default recommended 644 setting.

  Note: This module can be removed altogether once Red Hat Single Sign-On 7
        OpenShift container images don't need to support OpenShift v3.x.

        Starting from OpenShift v4.2 onward the CRI-O OpenShift run-time engine
        inserts the random user for the container into /etc/passwd:
        * https://access.redhat.com/articles/4859371
        * https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/2022/commits/77408ef1490002e62c88baacc5c994e97aa793c6

        which avoids the need to perform additional custom modification on
        per image basis to achieve image support for arbitrary user IDs.

  Important: This module is used (called) by the 'sso-jdk' module. If per
        the above suggestion, this module is not needed anymore (is to be
        removed), be sure to remove mention of this module in the 'sso-jdk'
        module too !!!
