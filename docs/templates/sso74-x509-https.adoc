== Parameters

Templates allow you to define parameters which take on a value. That value is then substituted wherever the parameter is referenced.
References can be defined in any text field in the objects list field. Refer to the
https://docs.openshift.org/latest/architecture/core_concepts/templates.html#parameters[Openshift documentation] for more information.

== Objects

The CLI supports various object types. A list of these object types as well as their abbreviations
can be found in the https://docs.openshift.org/latest/cli_reference/basic_cli_operations.html#object-types[Openshift documentation].


=== Services

A service is an abstraction which defines a logical set of pods and a policy by which to access them. Refer to the
https://cloud.google.com/container-engine/docs/services/[container-engine documentation] for more information.

|=============
|Service        |Port  |Name | Description

.1+| `${APPLICATION_NAME}`
|8443 | --
.1+| The web server's https port.
.1+| `${APPLICATION_NAME}-ping`
|8888 | ping
.1+| The JGroups ping port for clustering.
|=============



=== Routes

A route is a way to expose a service by giving it an externally-reachable hostname such as `www.example.com`. A defined route and the endpoints
identified by its service can be consumed by a router to provide named connectivity from external clients to your applications. Each route consists
of a route name, service selector, and (optionally) security configuration. Refer to the
https://docs.openshift.com/enterprise/3.0/architecture/core_concepts/routes.html[Openshift documentation] for more information.

|=============
| Service    | Security | Hostname

|`${APPLICATION_NAME}-https` | TLS reencrypt | <default>
|=============




=== Deployment Configurations

A deployment in OpenShift is a replication controller based on a user defined template called a deployment configuration. Deployments are created manually or in response to triggered events.
Refer to the https://docs.openshift.com/enterprise/3.0/dev_guide/deployments.html#creating-a-deployment-configuration[Openshift documentation] for more information.


==== Triggers

A trigger drives the creation of new deployments in response to events, both inside and outside OpenShift. Refer to the
https://access.redhat.com/beta/documentation/en/openshift-enterprise-30-developer-guide#triggers[Openshift documentation] for more information.

|============
|Deployment | Triggers

|`${APPLICATION_NAME}` | ImageChange

==== Replicas

A replication controller ensures that a specified number of pod "replicas" are running at any one time.
If there are too many, the replication controller kills some pods. If there are too few, it starts more.
Refer to the https://cloud.google.com/container-engine/docs/replicationcontrollers/[container-engine documentation]
for more information.

=== External Dependencies








[[tls]]
== TLS/SSL configuration

Red Hat Single Sign-On server can be configured to use TLS for handling incoming connections (also known as Key Store) and outgoing connections (also known as Trust Store). The configuration uses an automated script to convert a key or a certificate from PEM format into JKS, which is then consumed by Red Hat Single Sign-On.

The Key Store configuration requires a secret (or a volume), containing the key in PEM format, mounted at `/etc/x509/https`. The name of the file that holds the key is `tls.key` by default. Typically, a key is link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.11/dev_guide/secrets.html#service-serving-certificate-secrets[created by OpenShift and mounted as a secret.] The `sso-*-x509-https.json` template contains a example of such a configuration.

The Trust Store configuration uses certificates in PEM format. They should be mounted somewhere in the Pod and `X509_CA_BUNDLE` variable should point to them. A typical example is using the CA bundle provided by OpenShift - `/var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/ca.crt`. The `X509_CA_BUNDLE` variable might be configured to point to a custom file system path within the Pod, containing the set of CA certificates to use. The space (` `) character is used as a separator for specifying multiple CA bundles.

TIP: With the current implementation it is possible to use `X509_CA_BUNDLE` along with `SSO_TRUSTSTORE_*`. However, the current implementation favors the `X509_CA_BUNDLE` variable and in some cases, `SSO_TRUSTSTORE_*` might be ignored. This behavior is implementation dependent and may change in the future.
